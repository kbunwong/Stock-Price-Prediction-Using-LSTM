## Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the field of financial analysis. It involves forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), has gained popularity for its ability to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in time-series data, making it suitable for predicting stock prices. It's particularly well-suited for tasks involving time-series data because it can handle long-term dependencies and memory. LSTM cells have built-in mechanisms to learn which information to keep, forget, and output, which makes them powerful for modelling sequential data. When using LSTM for stock price prediction, the basic idea is to train the network on historical stock price data and then use it to predict future prices. 

## Executive Summary

We use a publicly available dataset containing historical stock prices of various companies. The dataset includes features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. We preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and perform any necessary data transformations. The LSTM model is built using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We employ techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting. Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the testing dataset. We compute various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy. We visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices to gain insights into the model's performance.

## Results and Discussion

In this section, we present the results of our stock market prediction experiments. We discuss the model's performance, its strengths, limitations, and potential areas of improvement. We also provide visualizations of the predicted stock prices and compare them with the actual prices.

Note that while LSTM models can provide insights into stock price trends, actual stock market behaviour is influenced by various complex factors. Predictions should be used for informational purposes and not solely for making investment decisions.
